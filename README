Spin up a Jenkins server using the directions in the dockerstuff
dir. Should run a simple server for testing/demo purposes in a
docker container.

Create a virtualenv to install JJB into:
`virtualenv venv`

Install JJB into that venv (note we install from source):
`venv/bin/pip install /path/to/jjb/repo`

Edit jjb.ini to match the user info in your Jenkins server.

Now you can add jobs, to see the xml that would be used:
`venv/bin/jenkins-jobs --conf jjb.ini test demo/1.first_job`

To upload this job to jenkins:
`venv/bin/jenkins-jobs --conf jjb.ini update demo/1.first_job`

Clark's Helpful Disclaimer:
We don't use Jenkins in very complicated ways. Uncomplicated Jenkins
Mostly scales, is easy to debug, and easy to modify/fix without getting
hip deep in Java. So you may find that my ideas around what you should
do with Jenkins don't line up with yours. But thats OK! because JJB
is happy to support Jenkins not just my Jenkins.
